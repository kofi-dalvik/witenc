# Witness Encryption based on BLS signatures

Implements a signature based witness encryption scheme based on the BLS signatures.

Uses the following implementations from [Chia-Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures/tree/main/python-impl)
- the BLS12 curve and optimal ate pairing
- BLS signatures.
